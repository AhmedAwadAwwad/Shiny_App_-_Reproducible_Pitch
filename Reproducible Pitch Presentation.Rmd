## Coursera Reproducible Pitch

This is a task for the data science coursera course about developing data products for week 4. As part of this, I have created a shiny app and deployed it on the shiny server. The link is https://innovator.shinyapps.io/Cars/. The code can be found at https://github.com/AhmedAwadAwwad/Shiny_App_-_Reproducible_Pitch.

## Overview

The shiny app plots graph against miles per gallon (mpg) for different variables from the mtcars dataset.

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```


## Plot Between Speed and Distance

```{r cars, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```


## Thanks
